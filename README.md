# finding-anagram
This week one of the tasks at I4GxZuri Training one of my tasks was to... 
Download the Starter Project. Open “main.py”, and complete the function “find_anagrams”.
It should accept two strings, and determine if they are anagrams. You should read more about anagrams. 
Your function should return True if they are anagrams, else False.
