# finding-anagram
## This week one of the tasks at I4GxZuri Training one of my tasks was to.
#### Intructions
<br>
1) Download the Starter Project “main.py”, and complete the function “find_anagrams”.
<br>
2) It should accept two strings, and determine if they are anagrams. You should read more about anagrams. 
<br>
3) Your function should return True if they are anagrams, else False.
